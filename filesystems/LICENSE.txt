 File System Wrapper License
=============================

The various parts of the File System Wrapper source code come from
different sources and may carry different licenses. Here's a quick
account of the situation:

 * The core code was written from scratch and is covered by a
   BSD-style license.

 * The EFI host driver was written from scratch, possibly using code
   from the TianoCore project and Intel's EFI Application Toolkit. It
   is covered by a BSD-style license.

 * The ext2 and reiserfs file system drivers use definitions from the
   Linux kernel source. The actual code was written from scratch,
   using multiple sources for reference. These drivers are covered by
   the GNU GPL.

For more details, see each file's boilerplate comment. The full text
of the GNU GPL is in the file LICENSE_GPL.txt.
